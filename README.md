# grokking_algorithms

I wanted to re-review basic data structures and algorithms using the Grokking Algorithms book.
I took this as s justification to try implementing each algorithm encountered in Rust.
That being said, after 4 chapters it became clear that I wouldn't use Rust for any or my projects because the added values didn't counter-balance my needs.
I would be more productive working with Python or Go, mainly because of not caring about memory management (lifetimes, box, borrows, ...).

That's the reason why starting chapter 5, this I've implemented things in Go instead.
